# Worker Agent Service

## Overview

The Worker Agent Service uses GPT technology to automate tasks by accessing external websites and APIs. It consists of the following components:
- **Agent GPT**: Generates tasks and subtasks.
- **Management GPT**: Reviews and approves/rejects tasks to ensure compliance with resource usage, operational policies, and priority rules.
- **Task Queue**: Manages task communication (e.g., AWS SQS).
- **Worker Agent Service**: Executes approved tasks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides oversight and auditing (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).

## Objectives

- Automate routine and complex tasks.
- Integrate securely with external systems.
- Maintain efficient resource usage.
- Ensure compliance.
- Provide scalable and reliable automation.

## Architecture

### Components

#### Agent GPT
- Generates tasks based on user input and predefined criteria.
- Interacts with external APIs to gather necessary information.

#### Management GPT
- Reviews tasks generated by Agent GPT.
- Ensures tasks meet predefined criteria for resource usage, compliance, and priority.
- Approves or rejects tasks based on these criteria.

#### Task Queue
- Manages communication between Agent GPT and Worker Agent Service.
- Uses AWS SQS to queue tasks.

#### Worker Agent Service
- Executes tasks approved by Management GPT.
- Interacts with external systems to perform tasks.
- Provides feedback to Agent GPT on task completion.

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Uses AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
- Tracks task execution and resource usage.
- Provides alerts for any anomalies or issues.

## Implementation

### 1. Set up AWS resources
- Create an SQS queue for task management.
- Set up CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.

### 2. Develop Agent GPT
- Use OpenAI's GPT API to generate tasks.
- Implement logic for task generation based on user input and predefined criteria.

### 3. Develop Management GPT
- Implement logic for reviewing and approving/rejecting tasks.
- Integrate with Agent GPT to receive tasks and provide feedback.

### 4. Develop Worker Agent Service
- Implement logic for executing approved tasks.
- Integrate with external APIs and systems.

### 5. Implement Logging and Monitoring
- Set up CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
- Implement alerts for anomalies and issues.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more complex tasks and workflows.
- Improve task prioritization and resource management.
- Enhance security and compliance features.
