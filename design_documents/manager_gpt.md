# Manager GPT Design Document

## Overview

Manager GPT is a supervisory component that oversees the tasks generated by Agent GPT. It ensures that tasks adhere to predefined criteria for resource usage, compliance, and priority. Manager GPT acts as a gatekeeper, approving or rejecting tasks before they are executed by the Worker Agent Service.

## Objectives

- Ensure tasks comply with resource usage policies.
- Maintain operational policies and priorities.
- Approve or reject tasks based on predefined criteria.

## Architecture

### Components

#### Task Review Module
- Reviews tasks generated by Agent GPT.
- Checks for compliance with resource usage policies.
- Ensures tasks align with operational policies and priorities.

#### Approval Module
- Approves or rejects tasks based on review findings.
- Provides feedback to Agent GPT on task status.

#### Integration Module
- Integrates with Agent GPT to receive tasks.
- Communicates with Worker Agent Service to pass approved tasks.

## Implementation

### 1. Develop Task Review Module
- Implement logic for reviewing tasks.
- Define criteria for resource usage, compliance, and priority.

### 2. Develop Approval Module
