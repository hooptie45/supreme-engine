## 1. Overview
AI Bootstrap is a project aimed at setting up an environment for brainstorming and developing AI-driven solutions. This document outlines the design, architecture, and implementation plan for the project.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
- Establish a collaborative environment for AI development.
- Pre-load the environment with existing design documents, coding standards, and preferences.
- Ensure interoperability with other AI workflows.

### Non-Goals
- Not focused on creating production-ready code in the initial phase.
- Not aimed at covering all possible AI use cases, but providing a flexible starting point.

## 3. Functional Description
- Load and parse design documents.
- Provide templates for new design documents.
- Ensure consistent coding standards and preferences are followed.

## 4. User Interface (UI)
- Simple web interface for accessing and managing documents.
- Wireframes for the main dashboard, document view, and editor.

## 5. Architecture and Design
- Component diagrams showing the interaction between the document manager, parser, and UI components.

## 6. Implementation Plan
### Milestones
1. Initial Setup
   - Create repository structure.
   - Implement basic document parser.
2. UI Development
   - Develop wireframes and initial UI components.
3. Integration
   - Integrate document manager with UI.
4. Testing
   - Implement unit, functional, and integration tests.

## 7. Technical Requirements
- Node.js for backend services.
- React for frontend development.
- Docker for containerization.

## 8. Testing Plan
- Unit tests for individual components.
- Functional tests for complete workflows.
- Integration tests to ensure components work together as expected.

## 9. Appendices
- Glossary of terms.
- References to coding standards and design principles.
