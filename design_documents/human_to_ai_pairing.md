WIP Design Document for Human-to-AI Interactive Code Review and Pairing

1. Overview

This document outlines the concept and implementation plan for a human-to-AI interactive code review and pairing workflow for ChatGPT. The aim is to enhance the code review experience by enabling a more collaborative and iterative process between a human and AI. This includes defining a “review/pairing” mode that adapts interaction styles to focus on iterative improvements and leverages a knowledge base that the AI can learn from over time.

2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

	•	Enhance the interactive code review experience with ChatGPT.
	•	Implement a “review/pairing” mode that adapts the interaction style for iterative improvements.
	•	Build a knowledge base that the AI can learn from to provide better insights and suggestions over time.

Non-Goals:

	•	This is not intended to replace human code reviews but to augment them.
	•	The initial version will focus on Python and Ruby, with potential expansion to other languages later.

3. Functional Description

Review/Pairing Mode:

	•	When activated, ChatGPT will switch to a more interactive and iterative review process.
	•	The mode will allow for detailed discussions, suggestions, and improvements in code.
	•	Specific commands and modes will enable different types of interactions (e.g., /activate_review_mode).

Knowledge Base Integration:

	•	The AI will learn from previous interactions stored in a knowledge base.
	•	The knowledge base will include best practices, common pitfalls, and examples from past reviews.

Interactive Features:

	•	Step-by-step code reviews with explanations.
	•	Automatic identification of potential improvements.
	•	Interactive discussions about code design and architecture.

4. User Interface (UI)

Activation:

	•	A simple command to activate review/pairing mode, e.g., /activate_review_mode.

Interaction Flow:

	•	The UI will display suggestions and allow for back-and-forth interactions.
	•	Users can approve or reject suggestions, and the AI will adapt based on feedback.

5. Architecture and Design

System Components:

	•	User Interface: A chat interface to interact with the AI.
	•	Review Engine: The core logic for interactive reviews.
	•	Knowledge Base: A repository of past interactions and best practices.
	•	Learning Module: To update the AI’s understanding based on new data.

Component Interaction:

	•	The User Interface sends requests to the Review Engine.
	•	The Review Engine processes the code and interacts with the Knowledge Base.
	•	The Learning Module updates the Knowledge Base with new insights.

6. Implementation Plan

Milestones:

	1.	Initial Setup:
	•	Define the basic review/pairing mode structure.
	•	Implement basic interaction commands.
	2.	Knowledge Base Integration:
	•	Develop a system for storing and retrieving best practices.
	•	Integrate the Knowledge Base with the Review Engine.
	3.	Interactive Features:
	•	Implement step-by-step review features.
	•	Develop interactive discussion capabilities.
	4.	Testing and Refinement:
	•	Conduct extensive testing to ensure functionality.
	•	Refine based on user feedback.

7. Technical Requirements

Hardware Requirements:

	•	Standard server setup to host the AI and Knowledge Base.

Software Requirements:

	•	Ruby and Python environments for running the scripts.
	•	Thor for task automation.
	•	Bundler for dependency management.

Dependencies:

	•	Thor
	•	RSpec for testing
	•	FileUtils and Pathname for file management

8. Testing Plan

Unit Tests:

	•	Test individual components of the Review Engine and Knowledge Base.
	•	Example: Testing the generate_required_content method to ensure it correctly formats file names.

Functional Tests:

	•	Test the functionality of the generator as a whole.
	•	Example: Running the generator and verifying that all required files and directories are created with the correct content.

Integration Tests:

	•	Test how different parts of the system work together.
	•	Example: Verifying that the generated files are correctly placed in the file system and contain the expected content.

9. Appendices

Glossary:

	•	Review/Pairing Mode: A mode in which ChatGPT adapts to a more interactive code review process.
	•	Knowledge Base: A repository of past interactions and best practices that the AI learns from.
